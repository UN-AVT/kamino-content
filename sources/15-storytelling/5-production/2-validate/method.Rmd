Analysing complex policy fields and developing futures scenarios presents us with a number of diffi cult methodological problems. Firstly, many, if not all of the factors involved are non-quantifiable, since they contain strong social-political dimensions and conscious self-reference among actors. Secondly, the uncertainties inherent in such problem complexes are in principle non-reducible, and often cannot be fully described or delineated. Finally, the actual process by which conclusions are drawn in such studies is often difficult to trace - i.e. we seldom have an adequate “audit trail” describing the process of getting from initial problem formulation to specific solutions or conclusions. Without some form of traceability we have little possibility of scientific control over results, let alone reproducibility.

### (In)consistency
#### with custom styling

The inconsistency problem can be stated as: depending on the method selected for analysis, the dataset used, the time frame studies, one often gets confl icting results. The lack of consensus on results and their implications leads to a credibility problem where policy makers do not seem to utilize the results. Several solutions to the problem are off ered...these solutions call for a great use of sensitivity analysis through: combining multiple methods of inquiry to test theories.


### Completeness
#### with custom styling

* What set of hypotheses was being considered?
* Was the set comprehensive, or was there bias in the selection of hypotheses? 
* What a priori probability was attached to each hypothesis? Again, was there bias?
* Was there a good understanding about the observables that were expected to differentiate between the hypotheses?
* Was intelligence collection requested on the basis of these differentially diagnostic observables?
* Were all the available data considered? How were the data weighted? What degree of credibility was accorded the sources?
* Was the possibility of deception considered and accounted for?
* Was the analytic process logically correct? Was the confi dence in rendered judgments correctly estimated? If so, and if the confi dence was low, was additional collection requested?
