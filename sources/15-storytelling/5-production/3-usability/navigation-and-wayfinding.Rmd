In his book The Image of the City (1960), Kevin Lynch coined the term “wayfi nding” to describe his concept of environmental legibility—that is, the elements of the built environment that allow us to navigate successfully through complex spaces like cities and towns. Lynch describes a fi ve-year study that reveals what elements in the built structure of a city are important in the popular perception of the city. One of Lynch’s innovations was the concept of place legibility, which is essentially the ease with which people understand the layout of a place.

To understand the layout of a city, people fi rst and foremost create a mental map. These mental representations, along with the actual city, contain many unique elements, which are defi ned by Lynch as
a network of paths, edges, districts, nodes, and landmarks. First, paths are channels by which people move along in their travels. Examples of paths are roads, trails, and sidewalks. The second element, edges, are all other lines not included in the path group. Examples of edges include walls, and seashores. Next, districts are sections of the city, usually relatively substantial in size, which have an identifying character about them. The fourth element, nodes, are points or strategic spots where there is an extra focus, or added concentration of city features. Finally, landmarks are external physical objects that act as reference points.

Lynch made several conclusions from people’s responses in the experiment. Lynch took the areas that people found vivid and assigned these areas a high imageability ranking. Imageability, another term introduced by Lynch, is the quality of a physical object, which gives an observer a strong, vivid image. He concluded that a highly imageable city would be well formed, would contain very distinct parts, and would be instantly recognizable to the common inhabitant. He also explains that a well-formed city is highly reliant upon the most predominant city element, paths. Examples of well-designed paths may include special lighting and having clarity of direction (not being comprised of confusing or ambiguous turns). Similarly, edges, districts, nodes, and landmarks are favorable contributors to imageability if they are meaningful, distinct, and not confusing. These elements, when placed in good form, increase human ability to see and remember patterns, and it is these patterns that make it easier to learn.

Wayfinding has four core components:

1. Orientation: Where am I am right now?
2. Route decisions: Can I fi nd the way to where I want to go?
3. Mental mapping: Are my experiences consistent and understandable enough to know where I’ve
been and to predict where I should go next?
4. Closure: Can I recognize that I have arrived in the right place?
