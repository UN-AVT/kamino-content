The sense-making process 

Although presented in many academic and research-oriented forms, we define the sense-making process as the logical application of analytic methods for the purpose of revealing insight for a complex problem.

### Visualization for Understanding
#### with custom styling

Information visualization amplifi es human cognitive capabilities in six basic ways [Card et al., 1999]:
• by increasing cognitive resources, such as by using a visual resource to expand human working
memory,
• by reducing search, such as by representing a large amount of data in a small space,
• by enhancing the recognition of patterns, such as when information is organized in space by its
time relationships,
• by supporting the easy perceptual inference of relationships that are otherwise more diffi cult to
induce,
• by perceptual monitoring of a large number of potential events,
• by providing a manipulable medium that, unlike static diagrams, enables the exploration of a space
of parameter values.
Factors which promote situational awareness and sensemaking. Imagine an avionics system which required
pilots to sort through volumes of textual information. As illustrated in Figure X, many analytical reasoning
tasks follow a process of Information gathering, Re-representation of the information in a form that aids
analysis, Development of insight through the manipulation of this representation, and the Creation of some
knowledge product or direct action based on the knowledge insight.
Visual analytics could be used to facilitate any point along the sense-making cycle, such as accelerated search,
accelerated reading, accelerated extracting and linking, schema visualization, hypothesis management and
structured argumentation, or interactive presentation.
