Situations are structured parts of the world. A situation can be thought of as a limited view of reality. Situation awareness is therefore a __state of knowledge__ that strives to understand the reality to form as accurate a view and understanding as possible.  It involves forming an awareness of the _who, what, when and where_ of a given situation.

A key concept of SA are the __building blocks__ or __puzzle pieces__ that together form the picture.

* entities  (i.e., person, organization, place, or thing) of interest
* attributes that commonly and uniquely describe the entities (i.e., identity and descriptive features)
* relationships and connections among entities
* associating observations (_connecting the dots_) for all the above

In simple terms, SA is _knowing what is going on so I can figure out what to do._

### How it works
#### levels of progressive capability and maturity

Situational awareness is considered to have four levels of progressive capability and maturity:

* Level 1 is the basic awareness of available information.
* Level 2 includes developing a comprehensive view of the reality of interest. 
* Level 3 is the ability to predict what those elements will do in the future
* Level 4 is the ability to act proactively

### In practice
#### mission possible

SA most often involves critical operational activities and serves as the basis for decision-making.  SA has high demands for performance, where limits of capability may result in serious consequences.

### Measuring Situational Awareness
#### good enough is not good

Entity Knowledge Fidelity

How accurate is the understanding of an entity or relationship correspond to the ground truth reality.  

System Knowledge Fidelity

How accurate is the composite understanding of entities, their behaviors, and relations compared to the ground truth reality.  

Operational Value

The value of a situation estimate element measures how well the element meets the needs of a particular user and his/her application.  

Cost of Loss or Gain

The utility of a situation estimate element weighs the value of the element against the cost of producing the element.
