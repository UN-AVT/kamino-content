Critical thinking calls for a persistent eff ort to examine any belief or supposed form of knowledge in the light
of the evidence that supports it and the further conclusions to which it tends. It also generally requires ability
to recognize problems, to fi nd workable means for meeting those problems, to gather and marshal pertinent
information, to recognize unstated assumptions and values, to comprehend and use language with accuracy,
clarity, and discrimination, to interpret data, to appraise evidence and evaluate arguments, to recognize the
existence (or non-existence) of logical relationships between propositions, to draw warranted conclusions
and generalizations, to put to test the conclusions and generalizations at which one arrives, to reconstruct
one’s patterns of beliefs on the basis of wider experience, and to render accurate judgments about specifi c
things and qualities in everyday life.

The truly diffi cult problems of the information age are not technological; rather, they concern
ourselves – what it is to think, to reason, and to engage in conversation [using] … new analytic
techniques, new conceptual tools with which to analyze and understand the workings of the
human mind. Keith Devlin, Goodbye Descartes: The End of Logic and the Search for a New
Cosmology of the Mind, 1997

### What You Need to Know

Other approaches to defi ning critical thinking focus on the specifi c skills. For example, Diane Halpern
considers that:
[critical] thinking is the use of those cognitive skills or strategies that increase the probability
of a desirable outcome. It is … thinking that is purposeful, reasoned, and goal directed – the
kind of thinking involved in solving problems, formulating inferences, calculating likelihoods,
and making decisions, when the thinker is using skills that are thoughtful and eff ective to the
particular context and type of thinking task.24
Additional advocates of skills-based critical thinking include Edward Glaser and Alec Fisher, and their sets of
critical thinking skills include a number of elements common to those identifi ed by Halpern. The overlapping
competencies of critical thinkers as advanced by Paul and Elder and these three other proponents are
summarized in table 1
• Recognize problems or questions and fi nd eff ective means of solution
• Engage in meta-cognitive activities that identify assumptions, biases, and performance as
solutions are developed
• Interpret data, appraise evidence, and evaluate statements in order to recognize logical
relationships between propositions
• Infer warranted conclusions and generalizations from evidence
• Test generalizations and conclusions by seeking out contradictory evidence that enables them to
judge the credibility of claims
• Convey sound, well-reasoned arguments
• Focus on the process of reasoning with the intention of improving the process


### What You Need to Do

Paul and Elder also establish a set of intellectual standards that off er criteria for assessing the level and quality
of thinking. Intellectual Standards
• Clarity: understandable, meaning can be grasped
Accuracy: free from errors or distortions, true
• Precision: exact to the necessary level of detail
• Relevance: relating to the matter at hand
• Depth: containing complexities and multiple interrelationships
• Breadth: encompassing multiple viewpoints
• Logic: the parts make sense together, no contradictions
• Signifi cance: focusing on the important, no trivial
• Fairness: justifi able, not self-serving or one-sided.
While getting to the right-hand side of the spectrum on each of these standards in fi gure 3 is highly desirable,
the standard of thinking on an issue will vary based on the skills of the thinkers and the issues under scrutiny.
Assessing the resulting shortfalls in thinking reveals gaps that can be corrected. The continuum therefore
provides a detailed assessment by which thinking on issues can be improved.

### What You Should Do

These tools and techniques also must allow analysts to look at their problem at multiple levels of abstraction
and support reasoning about situations that change. Convergent thinking: assembling evidence to fi nd
an answer and Divergent thinking: thinking creatively to ensure that plausible alternatives have not been
overlooked.
People cannot reason eff ectively about hypotheses and scenarios that are unavailable to them [Garfi nkel,
1967]. A key to good analytic discipline is early identifi cation of competing explanations and chains of
reasoning for the issue under study. Awareness of the competing ideas must be maintained actively, so
that they are kept “alive” as analytic possibilities. Often the most plausible explanation will be researched
extensively, but a thorough check is to always revisit the key alternative ideas and ask, “If I were wrong, how
would I know?”
Additional analytical techniques include consideration of biases that may have precluded consideration
of important alternatives, sensitivity to potential deception in evidence, and in cases of high risk, devil’s
advocacy processes that assume a diff ering interpretation of data and attempt to reason in that direction,
exposing potential weaknesses in the product.
Magnum:
I’m not really sure which kind of private investigator I am. The Holmesian-type with the
constant deductive mind, or one with a Marlowe-type intuitive sense of the darker side of
human nature? Hopefully a combination of both. At any rate, it doesn’t matter. Not when you
have a “little voice”. I don’t know, maybe a gently nagging “little voice” is just another way of
adding what you know, to what you feel... (Narration)
The analyst collects and organizes information as he or she progresses toward judgment about a question.
Throughout the reasoning process, the analyst identifi es or creates tangible pieces of information that
contribute to reaching defensible judgments. Reaching defensible judgments is a subject of structured
argumentation and analytical logic.
