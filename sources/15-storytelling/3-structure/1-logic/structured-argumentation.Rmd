Structured argumentation enables an analyst to connect arguments to evidence in support of a hypothesis.
An argument consists of a set of inferences that captures the chain of reasoning which connects evidence
with a hypothesis. Analysis results derived from argument-based analyses are more rigorous, robust, and
less sensitive to analyst’s bias than results derived from ad hoc approachesX. This logic serves two benefi ts:
fi rst and foremost, it ensures the “well-formedness” of the analysis process. Secondly, it is used to capture
reasoning carried out by the analyst.
An argument ties facts and evidence to a conclusion via a logical sequence. At its most basic level, an argument
consists of hypotheses, evidence, and inferences arranged in proof forms that capture the relationships
among the evidence and hypotheses. Typically an argument has an internal structure, comprising of the
following a set of assumptions or premises, a method of reasoning, and a conclusion or theory. The famous
detective Sherlock Holmes explains to Dr. Watson his investigative method, which is founded both on
evidence (observation) and on inference (deduction):
“For example, observation shows me that you have been to the Wigmore Street Post-Offi ce this
morning, but deduction lets me know that when there you dispatched a telegram.” A. Conan
Doyle, Sign of the four, Chapter 1
This “play of words” was likely referring to John Henry Wigmore, a famous evidence scholar, developed a
graphical method for charting legal evidence that used an elaborate syntax and set of symbols for representing
statements, propositions, evidence, and inferential links. In 1913, John Henry Wigmore proposed a chart
method for analysing the mass of evidence presented in a legal case, in order to help the analyst reach a
conclusion:
Our object then, specifi cally, is in essence: “To perform the logical (or psychological) process of
a conscious juxtaposition of detailed ideas for the purpose of producing rationally a single fi nal
idea.” Wigmore, 1913, 2nd Edition 1931, p. 109).
He sets out the “necessary conditions” for such an “apparatus”, following what we would now recognise as a
model of structured argumentation. For a given case, one must be able to express diff erent types of evidence,
relations between facts, represent and on demand see all the data, and distringuish be facts as alleged and
facts as believed or disbelieved.
“Hence, although we may not be able to demonstrate that we ought to reach that belief
or disbelief, we have at least the satisfaction of having taken every precaution to reach it
rationally. Our moral duty was to approximate, so far as capable, our belief to the fact. We have
performed that duty, to the limits of our present rational capacity. And the scheme or method,
if it has enlarged that capacity, will have achieved something worthwhile.” (p.111)
Wigmore provided an excellent departure point for further development of structured argumentation
approaches. In 1958, in his work The Uses of Argument, Stephen Edelston Toulmin developed a view of logic
which was grounded in the study of reasoning practice. Toulmin emphasized a number of points highlighting
the importance of reasoning and argument involve not only support for points of view, but also attack against
them. Toulmin’s views led to the introduction of what would become The Toulmin model of argument.
Toulmin model of argument provides the groundwork for the analyst to structure the evidence, supporting
facts, refuting evidence and their confi dence level based on the support for proof of the hypothesis. It is
based on Toulmin’s belief that a good argument can succeed in providing good justifi cation to a claim, which
will stand up to criticism and earn a favourable verdict. Toulmin proposed a layout containing six interrelated
components for analysing arguments as illustrated in Figure X.
The Toulmin model serves as an excellent basis for credible analytical logic when addressing wicked problems.
As descibed by John Tukey,
The Scotland Yard detective, however, would be far from useless in the wild west or the
outback. He has certain general understandings of conventional detective work that will help
him anywhere. (Tukey)
Structured argumentation provides the general understandings of conventional “detective work” which
are applicable to any analytical task. This point was reinforced by Rittel: My recommentation would be to
emphasise investigations into the understanding of designing as an argumentative process. Rittel’s work
established a bridge between design and argumentation. The argumentative approach to design elevated
the importance of the process of understanding a problem. Rittel and Webber hypthosized that a particularly
powerful way to tackle such problems is by an “argumentative approach”
