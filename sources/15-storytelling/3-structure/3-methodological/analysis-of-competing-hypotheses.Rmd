ACH is a method for how to think about a complex problem when the available information is conflicting, incomplete or ambiguous. ACH is a tool to aid judgment on important issues requiring careful weighing of alternative explanations or conclusions. It is particularly appropriate for controversial issues when analysts want to develop a clear record that shows what theories they have considered and how they arrived at their judgments. In addition to the direct benefit the process can have on analysis results, the method is __transparent and open__ for other analysts and decision-makers to review the results and identify areas of agreement and disagreement.

### When to use
#### a structured approach

ACH is a __structured__ process for making well-reasoned analytical judgments. It is particularly useful for issues that require a careful weighing of alternative explanations of what has happened or is happening. ACH can also be used to provide early warning or help you evaluate alternative scenarios of what might happen in the future. ACH can help minimize some of the __cognitive limitations__ that may __bias__ analysis.

The process provides a formal approach for breaking a complex analytical problem into __evidence, arguments, and hypotheses__, guiding you to __question your assumptions__ and to explore new ideas and theories that contribute to a better understanding of the issue. The value of ACH is measured by the extent to which it helps you see an issue from alternative perspectives and exhausting the search for additional evidence. It helps you stimulate a systematic and creative thinking approach to problem solving.


### How it works
#### the matrix 

The method is based on the premise that an analyst should explicitly identify all the reasonable __alternatives__ and have them __compete against each other__ to confirm or disprove based on evidence. As such, there are three guiding principles to the method:

* Start with a full set of alternative possibilities. This ensures that alternative hypotheses receive __equal treatment__.
* Identify the evidence or assumptions that have the greatest __diagnostic value__ in judging the relative likelihood of the alternative hypotheses.
* Seek evidence to __refute__ hypotheses in contrast to conventional approaches that entail looking for evidence to confirm a favored hypothesis.

Using ACH encourages analysts to set aside their __preconceptions__ and look for inconsistencies in the data that may indicate a flaw in their reasoning or inconsistencies from data and information sources. 

### In practice
#### vanished without a trace 

To illustrate the process, we'll take a <u>satirical</u> view of an unsolved mystery relating to the disappearance and subsequent investigation into the fate of American labor union leader Jimmy Hoffa. On July 30, 1975 he vanished without a trace. Despite a decades-long investigation, no one has ever been charged with his murder. His body has never been found.  He was legally declared “presumed dead” in 1982.

There were __dozens of theories__ about who killed him, where, and why. And there were __hundreds of theories__ as to where his body wound up. The mystery of the case offers a simple example for applying the ACH process to evaluate evidence and judge the confidence of several hypotheses.  


```{r, out.width = "1080px", fig.align = 'center', fig.cap="Process Overview"}

knitr::include_graphics("assets/ach/ach.svg", dpi=300)

```

<div class="figure-text">What happened to Jimmy Hoffa?</div>

As shown in the illustration, the hypotheses, evidence, and judgments are entered into a __matrix__ that becomes a record of your analysis process. This written record is what helps you deal with the complexity inherent in most analytical problems, as well as serving as a __defensible record__ of your findings.

ACH is an effective method for increasing the rigor, diligence, and credibility of your analysis process.
