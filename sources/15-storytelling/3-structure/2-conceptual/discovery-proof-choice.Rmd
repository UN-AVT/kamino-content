The Discovery-Proof-Choice (DPC) concept was popularized by David Schum in his work the Probability and the Process of Discovery, Proof, and Choice. The concept was applied to the legal and intelligence domain to describe a process for making a credible case for judgement based on evidence. This approach is described in The Art and Science of the Process of Intelligence Analysis, ...the collection of relevant and credible intelligence evidence of a variety of sorts is vitally necessary. But collection by itself, however necessary, is not suffi cient; we must become more adept at drawing imaginative, defensible and persuasive conclusions from it. It would not be stretching the point to say that our future may depend upon your ability to productively generate imaginative and plausible hypotheses and then to be able to defend hypotheses you believe are most likely based on coherent and persuasive arguments you construct from the evidence at hand. These are the core activities of intelligence analysis — the “science of analysis,” if you will — discovery, proof, and choice. (125)

Discovery consists of three aspects: the generation of theories and hypothesis, the elimination of possibilities, and argument structuring. Proof refers to the ability to demonstrate a chain of reasoning and argumentation based on examined evidence. Choice is generally a judgement made upon review of the proof presented, either in support of the fi ndings or against.

Logic is concerned with the soundness of the claims we make — with the solidity of the grounds we produce to support them, the fi rmness of the backing we can provide for them — or, to
change the metaphor, with the sort of case we can present in defense of our claims. The legal analogy implied in this last way of putting the point can be of real help … logic (we may say) is
generalised jurisprudence. (Stephen Toulmin, The Uses of Argument)

Toulmin’s point reinforces how using discovery, proof, and choice as a guide to structuring our analysis adds “soundness” and credibility to our work. Following this approach we move forward to laying out the structure of our analysis task.
