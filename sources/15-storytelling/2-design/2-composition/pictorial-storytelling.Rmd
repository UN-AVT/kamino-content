### Sequential Art
#### with custom styling

Sequential art is a term coined by Will Eisner in his 1985 book, Comics and Sequential Art. Eisner defined
sequential art as
“...the arrangement of pictures or images and words to narrate a story or dramatize an idea.”

Sequential art is not a style of drawing, but rather the process of arranging multiple drawings, and words, together to form story. A cave painting from the caves at Lascaux in France. Cave painting is the earliest known form of sequential art. Frequently depicting animals, these illustrations were usually an illustrated chapter of a prehistoric tribe’s hunt for food. ca 170th century BC.

To be sure, readers of images have more sequential options than readers of sentences. The constraints of picture viewing are not as severe as those imposed by written expression. Reading images also involves a sampling or trial of several logical sequences before the viewer fi nds one that is capable of carrying him through a whole visual organization with some degree of formal, sensuous, or cognitive satisfaction.

“How they [the tools of visual art and design] are patterned and combined is what makes the stuff interesting and emotionally real. By synthesizing the visual mechanics of written
language with the eff ects of seeing, a comic strip “fools” you into the illusion of “theater” by letting you think you’re “watching” an event transpire, when you’re actually reading it!
Ware, qtd. in Sabin 41)3

Sequence art provides us with patterns for scenes, panels and frames. Follow principles of dashboard...

”a visual display of the most important information needed to achieve one or more objectives;
consolidated and arranged in a single space so the information can be monitored at a glance.”
(Few)


### Reading Track
#### with custom styling

The reading track is the natural pathway a reader’s eyes and attention will follow when looking at a document. This pathway has early origins in newspaper design promoted by newspaper designer Edmund C.
Arnold, considered by many to be the father of modern newspaper design. These concepts are known as the Gutenberg Rule or Z Pattern of Processing.

“Devices which lead a reader on a wild goose chase, disturb an effi cient pattern, or cause the slightest measure of distress, should be eliminated.”
“Any design which forces the reader to work against reading gravity, or fails to return him or her to a logical axis of orientation, tends to destroy reading rhythm and should, he asserts, be
outlawed.”

Arnold insists on design which pays tribute to the linearity of the Latin alphabet and the physiology of the act of reading. When we’re taught to read, we’re told to start at the top left corner of the reading matter and work our way across and down, going from left to right and back again, until we reach the bottom right corner. Arnold has devised what he calls the Gutenberg Diagram...the principles of which, he says, all design should respect.

He says the eyes fall naturally to the top left corner, which he calls the Primary Optical Area (POA). Then, the eyes move across and down the page, obeying reading gravity, and returning after each left-to-right sweep to an axis of orientation.

As shown in the diagram, the view space dissects the composition into four quadrants. In this case since we are designing for the web, it will be dictated by the screen resolution and location of the fold. The upper left quadrant is the fi rst area that a users eye will focus on. The eye will then sweep downward crossing the center or intersection of all four quadrants, before coming down to the bottom right hand quadrant. The upper right quadrant and lower left quadrants are called fallow areas. The top right is a strong follow area, where the lower left is a weak follow area. These areas will receive little visual attention unless they are emphasized through design. The top right will receive more attention than the lower left all other things equal.
