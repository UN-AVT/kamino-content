> We have to stop the blood flow. We have to be relentless in our pursuit for justice; in our pursuit for humanity. Nature is the mother of us all, and within all of us is the spirit of an eco warrior. The war on poaching is a war on greed, but what stands to be lost is priceless...\

### Load the data


```{r load-data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, class.source = 'fold-hide'}

url_root <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UN-AVT/kamino-source/main/sources/0-shared/data/"
url_file <- "price-of-pangolin/pangolin_scales.csv"
url <- paste0(url_root, url_file)
df <- read.csv(url, header = TRUE)
df

```

Pangolins are believed to be the world's most trafficked mammal, accounting for as much as 20% of all illegal wildlife trade. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), more than a million pangolins were poached in the decade prior to 2014.

The animals are trafficked mainly for their scales, which are believed to treat a variety of health conditions in traditional Chinese medicine, and as a luxury food in Vietnam and China. In Africa, pangolins are sold as a form of bushmeat, for ritual or spiritual purposes, and use in traditional African medicine. Many times the animal is trafficked just for clothing and fashion.

### Wrangle 

Is Currency

We can use regular expression to match if our cells are in the correct format. A currency might start with the $ sign and might have commas and decimals. Here we have the decimal and commas as optional. We can use the function <kbd>grepl()</kbd>

```{r , echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}

a <- gsub(" ", "", df$Price_per_kg)

df_1 <- grepl("(?=.*?\\d)^\\$?(([1-9]\\d{0,2}(,\\d{3})*)|\\d+)?(\\.\\d{1,2})?$", a, perl = T)
df_1

```

We can also validate with other rules such as the commas and decimals being mandatory. Here, we will make decimals required and commas optional.


```{r , echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}

df_2 <- grepl("^\\$?(([1-9]\\d{0,2}(,\\d{3})*)|0)?\\.\\d{1,2}$", a, perl = T)
df_2

```
As you can see, our Price column does not follow the decimal format. We can use additional currency formatters if we wish to do so.
