***

Investing in __family friendly policies__ is good for families, businesses and economies. But for too many parents around the world, policies, such as __paid parental leave__, breastfeeding breaks, childcare and child grants, are not a reality. Family-friendly policies matter because they help children to get a better start in life and help parents to find the right balance between their commitments at work and at home. Yet even some of the worldâ€™s richest countries fail to offer comprehensive solutions to all families.

Let's take a closer look at the situation.

### Ingest the source
#### maternity leave, payment rate


```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, class.source = 'fold-hide'}

url_root <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UN-AVT/kamino-source/main/sources/0-shared/data/"
url_file <- "more-money-more-time/more-money-more-time.csv"
url <- paste0(url_root, url_file)

df <- read.csv(url, header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
df


```


### Wrangle
#### select, clean, and factor


```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, class.source = 'fold-hide'}

# Select only the needed
df_complete <- select(df, c("Country", "Paid_maternity_leave_avg_payment_rate_percent", "Paid_maternity_leave_in_months", "difference_from_OECD_average"))

# Make sure we don't factor empty strings
df_complete <- filter(df_complete, nchar(Country) > 0)
# Factor the string fields
df_complete$Country <- as.factor(df_complete$Country)

# Remove incomplete cases
df_complete <- df_complete[complete.cases(df_complete), ]

df_complete

```
<kbd>Filter</kbd>

#### Where equal

Filter where country name equal to __Spain__ in the <span style="background: #E0ECF8; font-weight:bold">Country</span> column. 

```{r method: where equal, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}

df_1 <- df_complete %>% filter(Country=="Spain")
df_1

```
<kbd>Filter</kbd>

#### Where not equal

Let's say we want to eliminate, for some reason, <span style="font-weight:bold">Poland</span> from <span style="background: #E0F8EC;font-weight:bold">Country</span> from this data


```{r, message=FALSE, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}

df_2 <- df_complete %>% filter(Country!="Poland")
df_2

```
