From a sequence of these individual patterns,
whole buildings with the character of nature will form themselves
within your thoughts, as easily as sentences.
— Christopher Alexander

When more than 30 years ago architect Christopher Alexander influenced the architectural world with his
landmark book The Timeless Way of Building, he was introducing the idea of patterns. His thesis was that
one could achieve excellence in architecture by learning and using a carefully-defined set of design rules,
or patterns. This is the same principle we apply to Kamino.

Kamino Pattern Catalogue — for each activity we need to know what to do to carry out the specific tasks.
This is the purpose of the catalogue. The catalogue is a structure to codify the instructions or solutions needed
for each task, Based on a taxonomy (the learning path of Kamino), the catalogue is constructed to classify a
collection of solutions called patterns.

The pattern catalogue is to ensure a logical structure and organization of patterns.
Kamino Patterns — the intent of patterns is to capture the essence of the practice in a compact form that can be
easily communicated to those who need the knowledge. Presenting this information in a coherent, accessible,
and reusable form will enable you to quickly apply pre-built templates in your own analysis projects.
For every task outlined in this course, there is a corresponding pattern configured to illustrate how
to perform the task. Patterns in Knime are basically sequences of nodes in workflows.
