Two suicide bombers on foot, dressed in 'TFG uniforms' entered the compound while TFG forces were formed in ranks listening to speeches from TFG and AMSIOM officials. The suicide bombers remained undetected and managed to blow themselves up in close proximity to the TFG forces. Immediately after the PBIED attack a group of AS fighters, possibly also dressed in 'TFG uniforms', utilized the chaos created by the PBIED attacks and attacked the compound firing indiscriminately at TFG and AMISOM forces. Shooting could be heard from the compound and its surrounding for the next several hours. The fighting was closely followed by statements from both sides reporting conflicting numbers of casualties. An AS press statement claimed that 80 AMISOM soldiers were killed, while an AMISOM statement admitted three injuries. Although the exact number of casualties could not be independently verified available information suggests that some 18 AMISOM soldiers and around 22 TFG soldiers may have been killed. The largest number of casualties on the TFG side is believed to have been sustained by troops loyal to General Indha-Adde of the Ayr clan of Hawiye/Habr Gedir.
