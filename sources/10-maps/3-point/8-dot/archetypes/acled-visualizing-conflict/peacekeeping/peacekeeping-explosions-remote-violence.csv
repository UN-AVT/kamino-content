The statement, circulated on social media, declared that its fighters detonated an IED against an AMISOM vehicle in the vicinity of Tredisha.(km13 on the Afgoye road) in the outskirts of Mogadishu, on 26/04. The authors of the communique admitted not knowing what the results of the attack were: death or injuries, or mere damage to the vehicle. The African Union Mission representative in Somalia, Lt. Col. Joe Kibet, admitted that an IED had struck a convoy of six vehicles moving from a Ugandan AMISOM forward operating base towards Mogadishu International Airport but stated that the explosion had missed its target and caused no damage whatsoever. This was confirmed by Abdikamil Moalim Shukri, speaking for Somalia's Ministry of Internal Security. This statement marks the first time IS officially assumes authorship for an attack in Somalia.",0
