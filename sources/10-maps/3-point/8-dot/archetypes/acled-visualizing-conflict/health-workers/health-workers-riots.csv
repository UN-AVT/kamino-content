A clash between the groups ensued and continued until about 20 police officers arrived. Five ''unofficial medics'' were detained. The BLM group dispersed afterwards, but it is unclear whether or not any of the original participants remained in the area. Afterwards, around 50 people were ''cornered'' by police and some of these people discarded riot gear and hopped fences to escape. At some point, demonstrators in the vicinity of Flowers and Washington Blvd allegedly threw bottles at police. 54 people were arrested for failure to disperse, 40 of whom were also charged with blocking train tracks. Police cited another 30 for blocking an intersection. [size=around 100]",0

Proud Boys armed with baseball bats, Mass Resistance, QAnon supporters, supporters of the QAnon-linked 'Save Our Children' movement, Groypers, and Trump supporters attended. Counter demonstrators, including transgender people and members of Antifa, were also present and rallied in support of transgender people. The groups engaged in physical altercations that allegedly included throwing smoke bombs and other objects at officers and demonstrators throwing water bottles at each other. Officers in riot gear hit pro-LGBT demonstrators with batons and fired bean bag rounds, in an alleged excessive use of force against pro-transgender demonstrators. (Officers use of less lethal projectiles comes during an active federal restriction on LAPD's use of projectile launchers against crowds unless they 'pose a clear threat of serious bodily harm to others.') At least one officer shot a less-lethal round at a fleeing demonstrator. 38 to 40 pro-transgender supporters were arrested after officers attempted to kettle the demonstrators. Officers confiscated stun guns, knives, and pepper spray. Some demonstrators were allegedly injured by police. At least two journalists were allegedly physically assaulted by anti-transgender demonstrators. Additionally, one journalist was assaulted by pro-transgender demonstrators, one civilian was maced by a Proud Boy, and a medic was attacked by a group of Proud Boys. There were no reported arrests among right-wing demonstrators. [size=about 50-80]",0
