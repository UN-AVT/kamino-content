	example: sibling of #1423

animal death comments: Comments about the death of the animal.
	example: hit by a car

	example: juvenile, adult
	units: Any units should be defined in the remarks.

attachment type: The way a tag is attached to an animal. Values are chosen from a controlled list:
	collar: The tag is attached by a collar around the animal's neck.
	glue: The tag is attached to the animal using glue.
	harness: The tag is attached to the animal using a harness.
	implant: The tag is placed under the skin of the an animal.
	tape: The tag is attached to the animal using tape.
	other: user specified

beacon frequency: The frequency of the radio tag or tag retrieval beacon.
	example: 450.5
	units: MHz
	same as: tag beacon frequency

deploy off timestamp: The timestamp when the tag deployment ended.
	example: 2009-10-01 12:00:00.000
	format: yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.sss
	units: UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) or GPS time, which is a few leap seconds different from UTC
	same as: deploy off date

deploy on person: The name of the person/people who attached the tag to the animal and began the deployment.
	example: G. Smith

deploy on timestamp: The timestamp when the tag deployment started.
	example: 2008-08-30 18:00:00.000
	format: yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.sss
	units: UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) or GPS time, which is a few leap seconds different from UTC
	same as: deploy on date

deployment comments: Additional information about the tag deployment that is not described by other reference data terms.
	example: This deployment was excluded from analysis because the tag failed.

deployment end comments: a description of the end of a tag deployment, such as cause of mortality or notes on the removal and/or failure of tag.
	example: Data transmission stopped after 108 days. Cause unknown.

deployment ID: A unique identifier for the deployment of a tag on animal, provided by the data owner. If the data owner does not provide a Deployment ID, an internal Movebank deployment identifier may sometimes be shown.
	example: Jane-Tag42

duty cycle: Remarks associated with the duty cycle of a tag during the deployment, describing the times it is on/off and the frequency at which it transmits or records data.
	example: it turns off during the night
	units: Any units should be defined in the remarks.

e-obs acceleration axes: This tells you about the enabled ACC axes, like X and/or Y and/or Z (definition from "e-obs GPS-acceleration-tags application note: How to use the acceleration sensor, interpret, analyse its data and how to get values in m/s^2", 2011).
	example: XYZ
	units: none

e-obs acceleration sampling frequency per axis: This is the sampling frequency for one axis. Don't mix this up with the sampling frequency for all axes together. For example if you have three ACC axes enabled, then the sampling frequency for all axes together is three times the sampling frequency for one axis. The sampling frequency is measured in Hertz, which is the same as 1/second. For example a sampling frequency of 10 Hz means that you get 10 samples per second (definition from "e-obs GPS-acceleration-tags application note: How to use the acceleration sensor, interpret, analyse its data and how to get values in m/s^2", 2011).
	example: 5.93
	units: hertz (Hz)

e-obs accelerations raw: Acceleration along the X and or Y and or Z axes of the tag, depending on which axes were activated on the tag as described in the field e-obs acceleration axes. Measurements alternate one measurement for each active axis in alphabetical order. The values are digital readings between 0 and 4095 of the analogue digital converter on the tag, and can be converted to m/s^2 with proper calibration. These samples are made at the rate described by the field e-obs acceleration sampling frequency per axis starting with the first sample at the time described in the field e-obs start timestamp. Tags with numbers e-obs numbers 2242 and higher, which began being provided in spring 2012, have Y-axis values in the opposite direction from those in older tags (definition from "e-obs GPS-acceleration-tags application note: How to use the acceleration sensor, interpret, analyse its data and how to get values in m/s^2", 2011; Wolgang Heidrich, e-obs Digital Telemetry, personal communication, 2012).
