There are two common metrics to quantify spread.

* __Range__ : The range is the difference between the maximum value and the minimum value of the attribute. The range is simple to calculate and articulate but has shortcomings as it is severely impacted by the presence of outliers and fails to consider the distribution of all other data points in the attributes.
* __Deviation__ : The variance and standard deviation measures the spread, by considering all the values of the attribute. Deviation is simply measured as the difference between any given value (xi) and the mean of the sample (Î¼). The variance is the sum of the squared deviations of all data points divided by the number of data points.

Interquartile range can be used to identify outliers and to show interval of likely values. The z-score of individual values show how far that observation deviates from typical values. The visual representation of dispersion is a box plot where points within the box are withing interquartile range and points on the whiskers are outside.
