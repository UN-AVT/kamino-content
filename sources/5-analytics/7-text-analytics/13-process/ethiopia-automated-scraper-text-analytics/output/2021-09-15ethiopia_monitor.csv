That’s according to panelists at a Book Talk. The “Book Talk” was jointly organised by the Economic Commission for Africa or ECA’s Knowledge Management Section and the Information and Communications Technology Services Section (ICTSS) in collaboration with the Communications Section under the theme ‘Dangers/Risks of Cybercrime to E-Commerce in Africa’. 

(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The panelists all agreed that cybercrime can be an impediment to a thriving digital economy in Africa and requires international, regional, private sector cooperation. “Many domestic regulations on the internet are being enforced without paying due consideration to the global and universal nature of cyberspace, cyber security and its relevance for e-commerce,” said Almoustapha Cisse, ICTSS Chief. According to the chief, cybercrime has become a big issue in the world because of emerging technology and high internet penetration on the continent. Cisse said African governments should accept the standard cyber norms and international laws for a responsible state behavior in a cyberspace. Nnenna Ifeanyi-Ajufo, Senior Lecturer at the School of Law, UK’s Swansea University, said cyber governance and E-commerce play a critical role in ensuring cyber security, and that the interface between cyber governance, cybersecurity and economic viability is one of the most complex policy challenges in the current day digital economy in Africa. Ms Ifeanyi-Ajufo said, “It is important that African countries ratify the Malabo convention on cybersecurity and personal data protection to fight the threats of cyber security.” The Malabo convention on cybersecurity and personal data protection, she noted, is one of the most elaborate conventions in the world on cybersecurity and so African countries should ratify for it to be enforced. So far, only 10 African countries have ratified the Malabo agreement. For it to come into force, at least 16 African countries should ratify it. Ifeanyi-Ajufo said the measures implemented to ensure cyber security in Africa can stifle the continent’s thriving digital economy through restrictive legislations, unreasonable standards on internet security which can stifle businesses, deter foreign companies and affect consumers of digital services. However, simultaneous cybersecurity is essential to facilitate economic transactions via the internet. “To implement internet security, a delicate balance needs to be struck between security held by the governments, companies and internet users,” said Ifeanyi-Ajufo. Anand Ramaswamy, ICHIP Attorney Advisor, U.S. Mission to the African Union, said Africa is the fastest growing region of the world for Internet penetration and for use of mobile-based financial services, has become an increasingly attractive area for cybercriminals. Law enforcement officers, prosecutors, magistrates, and judges should fulfil their respective roles in increasingly complex environments, which require up to date skills and adequate tools, both technical and legal. “To fight the dangers and risks of cybercrime to e-commerce in Africa, countries need cyber security measures in place, law, law enforcement and consumer protection services,” said Mr Ramaswamy. Mactar Seck from ECA’s Technology, Climate Change and Natural Resource Management Division said cybercrime in Africa has increased because the growing internet penetration. He said between 2005 and 2020 internet growths in Africa was 10 % and it is projected to grow by three folds by 2025. Seck said ECA and its partners are working hard to promote e-commerce on the continent while helping countries to create and implement laws and policies on cyber security. “Most countries in Africa have policies on cyber security but operationalization is the problem. ECA is helping with capacity building,” noted Seck.","September 9, 2021"

In this regard, he said the government has purchased 400,000 tons of wheat to abate the burden of inflation.

The ministry of trade and industry said the procured wheat will start to arrive beginning from September. In addition, 53.9 million liters of edible oil has also been readied for distribution while 2 million quintals of Sugar are transported into the country as part of an effort to ease the rising inflation.

     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The Ethiopian Investment Commission (EIC) said the encouraging performance in attracting the FDI, amid the security and Covid-19 pandemic induced challenges, could be attributed to several reasons. “The sale of the first private telecom license, however, has been the main factor,” said Henok Solomon, Communication Director of the EIC. A Global Partnership for Ethiopia, a consortium of telecom companies, won a telecom service licence offering a $850 million bid. ‘Invests Keen on Agro-processing’ Apart from the license sale, Henok said the commission’s “intensive campaign to promote investment prospects  of Ethiopia has also played a key part in” recording the second highest FDI figure Ethiopia attracted in past five years. “This has particularly paid dividends in bringing more businesses to invest in agro-processing sector,” the communication director said. At least 19 foreign businesses invested in the newly inaugurated Yirgalem Integrated Agro-Industrial Park last year alone. The park is among the three Agro-industrial Parks launched in the 2020/21 Fiscal year.
