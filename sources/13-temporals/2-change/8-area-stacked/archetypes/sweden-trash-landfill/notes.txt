Most countries pile their trash up in huge heaps, or they bury it. But Sweden? Only one in every 200 tonnes ends up at a landfill site.

The rest gets either recycled, turned into biogas, or poured into “district heating” plants that provide hot water and electricity to the biggest cities.

Sweden’s need for trash is so large, in fact, that it imports hundreds of thousands of tonnes per year from neighbouring countries.

Similar district heating systems are growing in popularity worldwide because they save money, reduce emissions, cut down on landfill and lower the need for fossil fuel imports. Beautiful.
