# Faceting Charts 
## Faceting into Multiple Panels in ggplot2

Data is messy, often unbalanced and mislabeled. Data visualizations can be even messier, with lines overlapping, visuals being cluttered, or data points to small to be shown. The facet approach partitions a plot into a matrix of panels. Each panel shows a different subset of the data. 

There are two main functions for faceting :

* __facet_wrap()__ : wraps" a 1d ribbon of panels into 2d
* __facet_grid()__ : produces a 2d grid of panels defined by variables which form the rows and columns.


```{js, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

// Must be included to position footer
$(function() {
  $('.main-container').after($('.footer'));
})

```
