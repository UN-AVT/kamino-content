# Merimekko 
## Utilizing The Width of Bars


A Merimekko Chart (in short Mekko Chart) consists of two versions: A stacked Marimekko Chart and Bar Mekko Chart. Each version is similar to the Stacked Chart and Bar Chart respectively. However, the Marimekko Chart utilizes a variable width bar which is typically a measure of size, like revenue or profitability. To preserve the visual relationship between widths of different columns, there are no gaps between columns in a Mekko chart.  The height of the Mekko Chart can support various values such as absolute values, percentages or both.






```{js, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

// Must be included to position footer
$(function() {
  $('.main-container').after($('.footer'));
})
