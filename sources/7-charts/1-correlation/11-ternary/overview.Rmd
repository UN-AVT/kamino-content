# Ternary Plot
## Depicts Ratios of Three Variables


Ternary Plot or also know as the __Triangle__ __Graph__ is a perfect way to showcase the ratios of three variables. Ternary Graphs visualize the ratios between the three variables, by simply positioning a dot in accordance with its position on each of the three axes using barycentric coordinates.



Typical Uses:

* __Visualizing Data points__ : Visualize how data is distributed in a data set.
* __Classification__ : Done by breaking up areas of the ternary plot into different categories
* __Flammability Diagram__ : Show flammability in mixtures of fuel, oxygen and inert gas
* __Genetics__ : population genetics can be showcase in a variation of Ternary plot called de Finetti diagram.


A fourth variable can also be added into a ternary plot. For example, we can visualize the fourth variable by filling the plot with varying shades of color. We can chart a bubble graph inside a ternary plot (variations the size of the circle of the data points).
