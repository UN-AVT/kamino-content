# Box and Whisker Plot
## Depict Variation in Data by Quartiles

Box and Whisker Plots (or simply boxplots) are very useful plots in descriptive statistics to analyze groups of numerical data through a five-number statistical summary. Box and whisker plots help you to see the variance of data as well as potential unusual data points in a dataset called outliers. The box-plot is especially useful for indicating whether a distribution is skewed and for comparing between two sets of numerical data.


The five statistics summary that a box-whisker plot portray are:

* __Minimum Value__ : The smallest value in the data set
* __Second quartile(Q1)__ : The value below which the lower 25% of the data are contained
* __Median value__ : The middle number in a range of numbers
* __Third quartile(Q3)__ : The value above which the upper 25% of the data are contained
* __Maximum value__ : The largest value in the data set


If outliers are present, the whisker on the appropriate side is drawn to 1.5 * IQR rather than the data minimum or the data maximum. This way, outliers are not calculated into the statistics of the dataset and would not be recognized as the minimum/maximum. Small circles or unfilled dots are drawn on the chart to indicate where suspected outliers lie.
