From caves to computers, information visualizations have helped to convey complex subjects for hundreds of years. This history offers a wealth of proven solutions which continue to find application and high value as a means of promoting understanding and knowledge discovery. Our experience with information visualization has proven how we gain insight and make sense of highly complex issues with specialized visual representations. Learning from the past and evolving from the centuries of progress in information visualization, our goal is to learn, reuse, improve on these valuable lessons of the past ... to inspire new opportunities to invent, innovate to discover new approaches.
