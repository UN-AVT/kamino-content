##  [21] &quot;I. Introduction&quot;                                                                    
##  [22] &quot;1. Throughout their ranges, the great apes of equatorial Africa and&quot;                
##  [23] &quot;South-East Asia, specifically the gorilla, chimpanzee, bonobo&quot;                      
##  [24] &quot;(pygmy chimpanzee) and orangutan, are under increasing threat.&quot;                     
##  [25] &quot;Hunting for bush meat, trade in infant primates, war and&quot;                           
##  [26] &quot;conflicts, diseases such as Ebola and the destruction of forest&quot;                    
##  [27] &quot;ecosystems as a result, among other things, of unsustainable&quot;                       
##  [28] &quot;agriculture, logging and mining practices are causing a dramatic&quot;                   
##  [29] &quot;decline in ape populations and the loss and fragmentation of ape&quot;                   
##  [30] &quot;habitats, leaving scattered and increasingly vulnerable pockets&quot;                    
##  [31] &quot;harbouring small populations of apes.&quot;                                              
##  [32] &quot;2. Great ape habitats are rich in biodiversity and are vital for&quot;                   
##  [33] &quot;providing ecological security and life support systems, including&quot;                  
##  [34] &quot;food, fuel and medicine, to local people and indigenous&quot;                            
##  [35] &quot;communities. If managed in a sustainable way, these mainly forest&quot;                  
##  [36] &quot;ecosystems can provide huge benefits for dependent human&quot;                           
##  [37] &quot;communities, great apes and other wildlife.&quot;                                        
##  [38] &quot;3. Although great ape conservation activities are taking place&quot;                     
##  [39] &quot;throughout great ape range States, conservation efforts would have&quot;                 
##  [40] &quot;a greater impact if they formed part of a systematic and&quot;                           
##  [41] &quot;prioritized approach. Furthermore, in order to ensure their&quot;                        
##  [42] &quot;sustainability, conservation efforts need to be complemented at&quot;                    
##  [43] &quot;the national and regional levels by policy actions and commitment&quot;                  
##  [44] &quot;by range State Governments, with the support of the international&quot;                  
##  [45] &quot;community.&quot;                                                                         
##  [46] &quot;4. The Great Apes Survival Project (GRASP) was launched by the&quot;                     
##  [47] &quot;Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme&quot;                     
##  [48] &quot;(UNEP) in September 2001, in response to the critical threats&quot;                      
##  [49] &quot;facing the great apes and the mainly forest ecosystems on which&quot;                    
##  [50] &quot;they depend for survival. When the project was launched, GRASP had&quot;                 
##  [51] &quot;a dozen partners, including three biodiversity-related conventions&quot;                 
##  [52] &quot;and nine non-governmental organizations. By the time of its launch&quot;                 
##  [53] &quot;as a partnership for sustainable development in September 2002 at&quot;                  
##  [54] &quot;the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, South&quot;                 
##  [55] &quot;Africa, this number had grown to a total of 21 partners, including&quot;                 
##  [56] &quot;the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural&quot;                            
##  [57] &quot;Organization (UNESCO) and virtually all the non-governmental&quot;                       
##  [58] &quot;organizations with major programmes in Africa or Asia dealing with&quot;                 
##  [59] &quot;ape conservation. The number of its partners continues to grow.&quot;                    
##  [60] &quot;5. GRASP works in cooperation with other United Nations bodies,&quot;                    
##  [61] &quot;international and regional financial institutions, regional&quot;                        
##  [62] &quot;bodies, foundations, donors, the academic community, the private&quot;                   
##  [63] &quot;sector and other interested parties so that, through regular&quot;                       
##  [64] &quot;communication and coordinated activities, the serious threats to&quot;                   
##  [65] &quot;great apes and their habitats can be eliminated.&quot;                                   
##  [66] &quot;II. Key principles&quot;                                                                 
##  [67] &quot;6. The key principles underlying GRASP are as follows:&quot;                             
##  [68] &quot;a) Becoming a GRASP partner is voluntary, on the basis of supporting&quot;               
##  [69] &quot;the GRASP mission, goal and objectives;&quot;                                            
##  [70] &quot;b) GRASP seeks to include all the main actors involved, either&quot;                     
##  [71] &quot;directly or indirectly, in the field of great ape conservation;&quot;                    
##  [72] &quot;c) GRASP does not seek to be prescriptive; GRASP actions should be&quot;                 
##  [73] &quot;supportive of and complementary to existing initiatives;&quot;                           
##  [74] &quot;d) At the level of the range States, key GRASP partners will be&quot;                    
##  [75] &quot;Governments, working closely wherever possible with non-&quot;                           
##  [76] &quot;governmental organizations, the academic community and the private&quot;                 
##  [77] &quot;sector;&quot;                                                                            
##  [78] &quot;e) GRASP should monitor progress towards its goals, at both the&quot;                    
##  [79] &quot;international and national levels.&quot;                                                 
##  [80] &quot;7. It is recognized that a wide range of skills and experience&quot;                     
##  [81] &quot;relevant to the conservation of great apes exists in both the&quot;                      
##  [82] &quot;government and non-government sectors. GRASP will seek to mobilize&quot;                 
##  [83] &quot;all available expertise for the conservation of great apes and&quot;                     
##  [84] &quot;their habitat.&quot;                                                                     
##  [85] &quot;8. In particular, GRASP will use its direct political links with the&quot;               
##  [86] &quot;Governments of range and non-range States and with international&quot;

##  [20] &quot;1. The rules for the organization and management of the Partnership&quot;           
##  [21] &quot;of the Great Apes Survival Project (GRASP) state that: \&quot;the GRASP&quot;            
##  [22] &quot;Council will meet every two years\&quot; and that \&quot;the Council will&quot;               
##  [23] &quot;decide the time and location of its meetings\&quot;. Representing the&quot;              
##  [24] &quot;GRASP Council in the interim, the Executive Committee is thus&quot;                 
##  [25] &quot;tasked with deciding on the timing of the next meeting. As the&quot;                
##  [26] &quot;first session of the Intergovernmental Meeting on Great Apes and&quot;              
##  [27] &quot;GRASP and the first meeting of the GRASP Council were held in&quot;                 
##  [28] &quot;Kinshasa in September 2005, it is time for the Executive Committee&quot;            
##  [29] &quot;to make plans for the next round of meetings.&quot;                                 
##  [30] &quot;2. The secretariat has identified the following main issues to&quot;                
##  [31] &quot;consider:&quot;                                                                     
##  [32] &quot;a) Whether to organize either a second session of the&quot;                         
##  [33] &quot;Intergovernmental Meeting or a second meeting of the GRASP&quot;                    
##  [34] &quot;Council or both;&quot;                                                              
##  [35] &quot;b) Specific timing of such meetings, bearing in mind the&quot;                      
##  [36] &quot;interval since the last meetings;&quot;                                             
##  [37] &quot;c) Location of the meetings;&quot;                                                  
##  [38] &quot;d) Focus and expected outcomes of the meetings;&quot;                               
##  [39] &quot;e) Funding.&quot;                                                                   
##  [40] &quot;3 Nature of the meeting&quot;                                                       
##  [41] &quot;3. The GRASP rules state the need for a meeting of the GRASP Council&quot;          
##  [42] &quot;every two years. Whether or not to hold a session of the&quot;                      
##  [43] &quot;Intergovernmental Meeting concurrently is a matter for the&quot;                    
##  [44] &quot;Executive Committee to decide.&quot;                                                
##  [45] &quot;4 Dates&quot;                                                                       
##  [46] &quot;4. While the GRASP rules do indicate that \&quot;the GRASP Council will&quot;            
##  [47] &quot;meet every two years,\&quot; the Executive Committee may wish to&quot;                   
##  [48] &quot;consider whether or not a meeting of the GRASP Council or a&quot;                   
##  [49] &quot;session of the Intergovernmental Meeting in 2007 are indeed&quot;                   
##  [50] &quot;priorities for the GRASP Partnership, given the amount of human&quot;               
##  [51] &quot;and financial resources required to organize and convene major&quot;                
##  [52] &quot;meetings. The Executive Committee may also wish to discuss the&quot;                
##  [53] &quot;number of days necessary for a successful major meeting (i.e.,&quot;                
##  [54] &quot;five or less). The secretariat notes that the Conference of the&quot;               
##  [55] &quot;Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered&quot;                
##  [56] &quot;Species decided to extend the interval between its sessions from&quot;              
##  [57] &quot;two years to three years.&quot;                                                     
##  [58] &quot;5. If Executive Committee members are aware of other major&quot;                    
##  [59] &quot;environmental forums with which the next meeting of the GRASP&quot;                 
##  [60] &quot;Council and session of the Intergovernmental Meeting should avoid&quot;             
##  [61] &quot;conflicting, the secretariat would appreciate being informed.&quot;                 
##  [62] &quot;5 Location&quot;                                                                    
##  [63] &quot;6. The only guidance that the GRASP rules provide in this regard is&quot;           
##  [64] &quot;to stipulate that \&quot;meeting locations will, as far as practical, be&quot;           
##  [65] &quot;rotated among the geographic regions\&quot; and that \&quot;the Council will&quot;            
##  [66] &quot;decide the time and location of its meetings\&quot;.&quot;                               
##  [67] &quot;7. As Cameroon was elected chair of the GRASP Council in Kinshasa in&quot;          
##  [68] &quot;September 2005, a venue in Cameroon may seem to be the most&quot;                   
##  [69] &quot;logical place for the next meeting of the GRASP Council and&quot;                   
##  [70] &quot;session of the Intergovernmental Meeting. The GRASP rules do not,&quot;             
##  [71] &quot;however, provide that the chair of the GRASP Council should&quot;                   
##  [72] &quot;necessarily host GRASP Council meetings.&quot;                                      
##  [73] &quot;8. To date, the secretariat has received no formal offers from GRASP&quot;          
##  [74] &quot;Partners to host the next meeting of the GRASP Council and session&quot;            
##  [75] &quot;of the Intergovernmental Meeting, although Uganda (formally) and&quot;              
##  [76] &quot;Nigeria (informally) did offer to host the 2005 meetings. In&quot;                  
##  [77] &quot;addition, there is no precedent to assist the Executive Committee&quot;             
##  [78] &quot;in selecting the location of the next meeting.&quot;                                
##  [79] &quot;9. It is therefore the opinion of the secretariat that the Executive&quot;          
##  [80] &quot;Committee may deliberate freely regarding a potential host&quot;                    
##  [81] &quot;country, and that consideration should be given to potential&quot;                  
##  [82] &quot;venues that are not in the Central Africa subregion. As a first&quot;               
##  [83] &quot;step, the secretariat could be asked to approach all range and&quot;                
##  [84] &quot;donor states to solicit offers to host the next meeting.&quot;                      
##  [85] &quot;6 Focus and expected outcome of the meetings&quot;                                  
##  [86] &quot;10. The first session of the Intergovernmental Meeting and first&quot;              
##  [87] &quot;meeting of the GRASP Council were primarily concerned with&quot;                    
##  [88] &quot;bringing together a number of relevant high level delegations and&quot;             
##  [89] &quot;GRASP partner organizations to adopt key GRASP documents,&quot;                     
##  [90] &quot;including the Kinshasa Declaration, generate political will and&quot;               
##  [91] &quot;support for great ape conservation, strengthen the Partnership and&quot;            
##  [92] &quot;pave a way forward for GRASP activities. The meetings in large&quot;                
##  [93] &quot;part achieved those goals.&quot;                                                    
##  [94] &quot;11. The second session of the Intergovernmental Meeting and second&quot;            
##  [95] &quot;meeting of the GRASP Council must build upon these successes but&quot;              
##  [96] &quot;also discuss important great ape conservation issues and generate&quot;             
##  [97] &quot;outcomes with an impact at the field level. The secretariat&quot;                   
##  [98] &quot;proposes in this regard that the meeting focus on one or two key&quot;              
##  [99] &quot;themes of high relevance to the great apes, their conservation and&quot;            
## [100] &quot;sustainable development for local peoples.&quot;                                    
## [101] &quot;12. Possible themes:&quot;                                                          
## [102] &quot;a) Major threats to great apes:&quot;                                               
## [103] &quot;(i)    deforestation;&quot;                                                         
## [104] &quot;(ii)   climate change;&quot;                                                        
## [105] &quot;(iii)  bushmeat.&quot;                                                              
## [106] &quot;b) Great ape conservation needs:&quot;                                              
## [107] &quot;(i)    sustainable financing;&quot;                                                 
## [108] &quot;(ii)   political will.&quot;                                                        
## [109] &quot;13. The Executive Committee may also wish to consider designing the&quot;           
## [110] &quot;meetings to reach a specific, ambitious objective, such as donor&quot;              
## [111] &quot;commitments or an international tax for great apes, which might&quot;               
## [112] &quot;mean inviting individuals who have not played a major role in&quot;                 
## [113] &quot;GRASP to date, such as finance ministries and industry&quot;                        
## [114] &quot;representatives. It may not be possible, however, to arrange a&quot;                
## [115] &quot;meeting to discuss more ambitious objectives within the time frame&quot;            
## [116] &quot;of one year.&quot;                                                                  
## [117] &quot;7 Fundraising for the meeting&quot;                                                 
## [118] &quot;14. Once again, depending in part on the venue chosen for the meeting&quot;         
## [119] &quot;and its duration, the secretariat expects that the cost of the&quot;                
## [120] &quot;next session of the Intergovernmental Meeting and GRASP Council&quot;               
## [121] &quot;meeting will be similar to that of the previous meetings held in&quot;              
## [122] &quot;Kinshasa, which cost $300,000&quot;                                                 
## [123] &quot;15. It should be noted that in 2005, funding from the European&quot;                
## [124] &quot;Commission came though at virtually the last minute before the&quot;                
## [125] &quot;first session of the Intergovernmental Meeting. That funding&quot;                  
## [126] &quot;proposal was submitted 18 months before the first session.&quot;                    
## [127] &quot;Currently, we do not have any funding proposals in the pipeline.&quot;              
## [128] &quot;16. Raising the resources necessary to convene the next meeting&quot;               
## [129] &quot;successfully is a task that should obviously be initiated as soon&quot;             
## [130] &quot;as possible. While the secretariat has a number of potentially&quot;                
## [131] &quot;interested donor countries and institutions that it can approach,&quot;             
## [132] &quot;the support and commitment of all GRASP Partners will be needed.&quot;              
## [133] &quot;In particular, employing the GRASP Patrons and other renowned&quot;                 
## [134] &quot;personalities earlier and more effectively than was done prior to&quot;             
## [135] &quot;the first session of the Intergovernmental Meeting may be a key&quot;               
## [136] &quot;strategy. In addition, any suggestions or specific contacts and&quot;               
## [137] &quot;ideas that Executive Committee members may have would be most&quot;                 
## [138] &quot;welcome.&quot;                                                                      
## [139] &quot;_____________________&quot;
