## [1] &quot;Quantifying Peace and its Benefits\nThe Institute for Economics &amp; Peace (IEP) is an independent, non-partisan, non-profit think tank dedicated to\nshifting the world’s focus to peace as a positive, achievable, and tangible measure of human well-being and\nprogress.\n\nIEP achieves its goals by developing new conceptual frameworks to define peacefulness; providing metrics\nfor measuring peace; and uncovering the relationships between business, peace and prosperity as well as\npromoting a better understanding of the cultural, economic and political factors that create peace.\n\nIEP is headquartered in Sydney, with offices in New York, The Hague, Mexico City, Brussels and Harare. It\nworks with a wide range of partners internationally and collaborates with intergovernmental organisations\non measuring and communicating the economic value of peace.\n\nFor more information visit www.economicsandpeace.org\n\nPlease cite this report as:\nInstitute for Economics &amp; Peace.

Countries with low and very\n low levels of peacefulness, as measured by the GPI, have suffered\n significantly more deaths than countries of high peace and very\n high peace. Very high peace countries have suffered 168,000\n deaths compared to the 3.2 million in very low peace countries.\n Countries of low and very low levels of peace have also endured a\n greater number of disasters compared to countries with high and\n very high peace. However, the average deaths per disasters are\n significantly higher in countries with lower levels of peacefulness.\n Figure 3.8 displays the number of disasters by peace level.\n\n\n FIGURE 3.7\n  Total deaths by peace level, 1945–2019\n Deaths from natural disasters have been higher in countries\n with lower levels of peace.\n\n                      4,500,000\n\n                      4,000,000                             3,817,553\n\n                      3,500,000\n                                                                          3,187,423\nNUMBER OF DEATHS\n\n\n\n\n                      3,000,000\n\n                      2,500,000\n\n                      2,000,000\n\n                      1,500,000\n\n                      1,000,000\n\n                       500,000                    371,575\n                                     167,833\n                              0\n                                    Very High      High       Low         Very Low\n                                     Peace        Peace      Peace         Peace\n\n\n Source: EM-DAT, IEP Calculations\n\n\n\n FIGURE 3.8\n  Total number of incidents by peace level,\n  1945–2019\n Countries with low levels of peace have suffered more natural\n disasters than countries of high peace.\n\n                      4,500\n                                                            3,974           3,981\n                      4,000\n\n                      3,500\nNUMBER OF INCIDENTS\n\n\n\n\n                      3,000\n                                                2,528\n                      2,500\n                                  2,137\n                      2,000\n\n                      1,500\n\n                      1,000\n\n                       500\n\n                          0\n                              Very High          High        Low         Very Low\n                               Peace            Peace       Peace         Peace\n\n\n Source: EM-DAT, IEP Calculations\n\n\n\n\n                                                                        ECOLOGICAL THREAT REGISTER 2020 ­| 55\n&quot;

## [1] &quot;Positive Peace, defined as the attitudes, institutions and structures that create and sustain peaceful\nsocieties, is an effective gauge for socio-economic resilience. This resilience is a fundamental tool for\ncountries facing ecological threats. Firstly, it provides a country with the capacity to cope with ecological\nshocks, minimising their negative impact on the population and economic structure. Secondly, it facilitates\nthe recovery or rebuild of the socio-economic system in the aftermath of an ecological shock.\n\nThe Ecological Threat Register (ETR) combines seven hazards – food insecurity, water stress, droughts,\nfloods, cyclones, rising temperatures, rising sea levels and population growth – to assess the overall level\nof ecological risk facing nations from now to 2050. This combination allows the identification of countries\nthat are particularly at risk from environmental factors and do not have the socio-economic resilience to\nmitigate these threats.\n\n\n\n\nEcological Threat Hotspots\n\nCountries that face a high number of threats and do not have the           and the central Asian belt from Syria to Pakistan.

## [1] &quot;   APPENDIX A\n\n   Ecological Threat Register Methodology\n   The concept of the Ecological Threat Register (ETR) was developed to identify the overall level of ecological risk\n   that countries face between now and 2050. Ecological threats included in the ETR are water stress, food\n   insecurity, droughts, floods, cyclones, temperature rise, sea level rise and population growth.\n\n\nAnalysis from the ETR allows for the identification of countries and regions where ecological crises are more likely to occur and\nhave a severe impact on populations residing in those areas. The ETR focuses on the impacts of resource scarcity and natural\ndisaster threats on peacefulness as well as the role of resilience in limiting the impact of such shocks.\n\nThe ETR is a multi-indicator composite register of risk, which is calculated in two steps. In the first step, all indictors are\nnormalised on a score of 1 to 5 with a higher score representing higher levels of risk. In the second step, the overall ETR count is\ncalculated as the sum of the individual ecological threats that exceed a specified level of intensity. The ETR count represents the\nnumber of threats a country faces such as water stress, floods and food insecurity.\n\n\n\n\nThe Indicators\nThe ETR is composed of the following eight indicators, scored                POPULATION GROWTH\nbetween 1 and 5, where 1 represents lower risk and 5 higher risk.            Population growth is calculated using the total resident\n                                                                             population in each country.
