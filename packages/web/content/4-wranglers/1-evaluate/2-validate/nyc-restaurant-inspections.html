<h3>Wrangle</h3>
<p>Is Length</p>
<p>String Length validation is especially useful to make sure the number of characters entered into a field can be restricted. It can be used to make sure the number of characters are the same throughout the column.</p>
<p>For example, United States phone numbers must be 10 digits. We can use this information to validate that all the cells in the column ‘Phone’ are 10 digits.</p>
<p>We’ll validate both Phone Number(10 digits) and Postal Code (5 digits) by using <kbd>nchar()</kbd></p>
<pre class="r"><code>nchar(df$ZIPCODE)== 5</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  [1] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE
## [16] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>nchar(df$PHONE)==10</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  [1] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE
## [16] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE</code></pre>
<p>We can also utilize <kbd>str_length()</kbd> from the stringr library</p>
<pre class="r"><code>str_length(df$ZIPCODE)== 5</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  [1] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE
## [16] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>str_length(df$PHONE)==10</code></pre>
